\maketitle

Our goal is to understand Kolmogorov's theorem:
\begin{thm}[Kolmogorov's Theorem]
  \KAM
\end{thm}
In particular the motion
\begin{align*}
  \bp{Q}(t) &= \bp{Q}(0) + t\omega_0,\\
  \bp{P}(t) &= 0,
\end{align*}
is a solution of the Hamiltonian equation that is conjugate to the linear flow
with direction $\omega_0$, so that the invariant torus $\bp{p} = 0$ is preserved
by the perturbation.

To read and then understand this theorem, we require some definitions and
notation.

If $(X, \sigma)$ is a symplectic manifold, then any function $H$ on $X$ has a
symplectic gradient $\sgrad H$ defined as the unique vector field such that for
any vector field $\xi$, it holds that $\sigma(\xi, \sgrad H) = d H(\xi)$.
The Hamiltonian differential equation is $\dot{x} = (\sgrad H)(x)$.

$\sgrad f$ has a flow $\phi^t_f$ such that $f \circ \phi^t_f = f$ and
$(\phi^t_f)^* \sigma = \sigma$.

\begin{defn}[Poisson Bracket]
The \emph{Poisson Bracket} of $X$ is defined by
  \begin{equation*}
    \{f, g\} = \sigma(\sgrad g, \sgrad f) = df(\sgrad g) = - dg(\sgrad f).
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}
Functions $f$ and $g$ \emph{commute} if $\{f, g\} = 0$.
This condition implies that their flows commute:
\begin{equation*}
  \phi_f(s) \circ \phi_g(t) = \phi_g(t) \circ \phi_f(s).
\end{equation*}
The symplectic gradient of the Poisson bracket is the Lie bracket:
\begin{equation*}
  \sgrad\{f, g\} = [\sgrad f, \sgrad g].
\end{equation*}
The Lie bracket $[X, Y]$ is the derivative of $Y$ in the ``direction'' of $X$.

\begin{exmp}[Hamiltonian Equations of Motion]
  Take $X = \R^{2n}$ with coordinates
  $(\bp{q}, \bp{p}) = (q_1, \ldots, q_n, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ and
  $\sigma = \sum_i \dif p_i \wedge \dif q_i$.
  Then the Hamiltonian differential equation becomes the \emph{Hamiltonian
    Equations of Motion}:
  \begin{align*}
    \dot{q}_i &= \pd{H}{p_i},\\
    \dot{p}_i &= -\pd{H}{q_i}.
  \end{align*}
  We can integrate these equations.
  The solution with initial conditions $(\bp{q}_0, \bp{p}_0)$ is
  \begin{align*}
    \bp{q}(t) &= \bp{q}_0 + t \pd{H}{\bp{p}}(\bp{p}_0) =: \bp{q}_0 + t
                \omega(\bp{p}_0),\\
    \bp{p}(t) &= \bp{p}_0.
  \end{align*}
  Each coordinate $p_1, \ldots p_n$ is conserved, and the motion is a linear
  motion on the torus $\mathbb{T}^n \times \{\bp{p}_0\}$.
  
  In this case the Poisson bracket is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \{f, g\} = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left( \pd{f}{q_i} \pd{g}{p_i} - \pd{f}{p_i}
      \pd{g}{q_i} \right).
  \end{equation*}
\end{exmp}
The Poisson bracket allows us to write Taylor Series as
\begin{equation*}
  f \circ \phi^t_g = f + t \{f, g\} + \frac{t^2}{2} \{ \{f, g\}, g\} +
  \frac{t^3}{3!} \{ \{ \{f, g\}, g\}, g\} + \cdots.
\end{equation*}

If an analytic function $f$ is bounded on an open set $U$ and if $V$ is
relatively compact in $U$, then we can bound the second derivatives of $f$ on
$V$ in terms of $\sup_U |f|$.
The important domains are
\domains{}
Denote by $\mathcal{B}_\rho$,
$\mathcal{C}_\rho$, and $\mathcal{A}_\rho$ the corresponding Banach algebras of
functions continuous on these compact sets and analytic on the interiors, with
sup-norm $\norm{f}_{\rho}$.
\begin{defn}[Banach Algebra]
  Let $k$ be $\R$ or $\C$.
  A \emph{normed algebra} over $k$ is an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ over $k$ with a
  sub-multiplicative norm $\norm{.}$, that is, for all $x, y \in \mathcal{A}$,
  we have $\norm{xy} \leq \norm{x} \norm{y}$,
  If $\mathcal{A}$ is a Banach space, then it is called a \emph{Banach algebra}.
\end{defn}
Elements of $\mathcal{B}_{\rho}$ can be expanded as Power series.
Elements of $\mathcal{C}_{\rho}$ can be expanded as Fourier series
$f(\bp{z})~=~\sum_{\bp{k} \in \Z^{2n}} f_{\bp{k}} \e^{2 \pi \i \, \bp{k} \cdot
  \bp{z}}$.
