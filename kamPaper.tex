% I know that I'm not supposed to use a citation in an abstract, but Hubbard
% did so in his paper, so I guess it is fair game.
\begin{abstract}
  This paper gives a proof of the Kolmogorov Theorem on the conservation of
  invariant tori.
  We follow the approach given by Hubbard and Ilyashenko in .
  Their proof is similar to the one given by Bennettin, Galgani, Giorgilli, and
  Strelcyn in , which itself resembles Kolmogorov's original argument.
  % TODO write citations and confirm correctness of the last claim by rereading
  % the other paper's abstract.
  % Also check the spelling of their names and add them to the dictionary.
  % Do by 4/14.
\end{abstract}

% TODO Fix up the historical information in the next paragraph

But before moving on, let's take a look at our main goal:
\begin{thm}[The Kolmogorov Theorem]
  \label{thm:KAM}
  \KAM
\end{thm}
We will return to this statement after building up some intuition for it.
